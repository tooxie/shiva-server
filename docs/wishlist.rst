Wish list
=========

This is a (possible incomplete) list of ideas that may be eventually
implemented. With time we will see which of them make sense (or not) and work
on them (or not). We may add things that are not documented here as well.

* Index also images and videos.
* Batch-edit ID3 tags.
* Download your tracks in batch.
* Users.

  + Join by invitation
  + Favourite artists.
  + Playlists.
  + Play count.

* Share your music with your friends.
* Share your music with your friends' servers.
* Listen to your friends' music.
* They can also upload their music.
* Stream audio and video. (Radio mode)
* Set up a radio and collaboratively pick the music. (Would this belong to
  Shiva or to another service consuming Shiva's API?)
* Tabs.


Assumptions
-----------

For the sake of simplicity many assumptions were made that will eventually be
worked on and improved/removed.

* Only music files. No videos. No images.
* No users.

  + Therefore, no customization.
  + And no privacy.

* No uploading of files.
* No update of files' metadata when DB info changes.
